  Welcome to the Game of Life implementation using MonoGame! 🎮✨

  The Game of Life is a cellular automaton devised by mathematician John Conway. It's a zero-player game where the evolution is determined by its initial state, with no further input from humans. Explore the patterns and behaviors of cells as they live, die, and evolve over time.
